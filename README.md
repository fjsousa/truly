Lisbon - Shoes Donors Matching
We need to match donated pairs of shoes (closed shoes, sport shoes, flip flops, ...) from different sizes with organizations/people asking for specific pairs of shoes.
The idea is simple and useful because it automates a manual and repetitive process of checking available shoes to the requests. I can be scaled to other types of goods, such as clothes, books, etc...
We found the need for this solution, since we organize a yearly request for used shoes during One Day Without Shoes day (http://www.onedaywithoutshoes.com/).
